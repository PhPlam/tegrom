# create models

This directory contains scripts to create a temporal graph in neo4j based on given molecules and possible transformations. The developed RelIdent-Algorithm will calculate and add the occuring transformations from all possible transformations over time to the graph. This allows the user to analyze the graph for the occurred transformations instead of only the possible transformations.
