This project belongs to the publications in the following paper: "A temporal graph to predict chemical transformations in complex dissolved organic matter" (Philipp Plamper, Oliver J. Lechtenfeld, Peter Herzsprung, Anika Gro√ü)  
  
The scripts contain methods to create a temporal graph from molecule data acquired over several discrete measurements. Additionally, several methods are provided to analyze the created temporal graph.
